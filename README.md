### Software Development

My software projects range from workflows to [process ocean color data from drones](https://github.com/aewindle110/DroneWQ) to [open access geospatial and remote sensing courses](https://github.com/patrickcgray/open-geo-tutorial) to [satellite analysis of ocean dynamics](https://github.com/earthcube2021/ec21_gray_etal) to [machine learning for detecting marine megafauna](https://github.com/patrickcgray/cetacean_photogram). I'm a strong proponent of open source science, teaching, and data.

### Short Biography

I'm currently Zuckerman Postdoctoral fellow with Emmanuel Boss and Yoav Lehahn at University of Maine and University of Haifa studying ocean optics and marine biophysical interactions. I just finished up my PhD with Dave Johnston in the Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing Lab at the Duke University Marine Laboratory and a Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST). My doctoral research focused on satellite, drone and in-situ optical observations of oceans and coasts. My work aims to understand spatial and temporal variability of ocean biology and ecology. Working at the confluence of remote sensing, data science, and biological oceanography I lean heavily on machine learning and scientific computing tools for parsing large amounts of data and connecting remotely sensed and in-situ oceanographic monitoring. I'm particularly interested in tools and research that will be relevant for Earth science and for exploring other bodies within our solar system.
